Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction 🌍

This project focuses on predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) using Machine Learning models.
It demonstrates the complete ML pipeline — from data preprocessing and feature selection to training, evaluation, and results.


📌 Features

>Dataset preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, normalization).
>Feature engineering to improve model performance.
>Implementation of multiple ML models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
>Model evaluation with accuracy metrics.
>AQI prediction and visualization of pollution trends.


📊 Results
>AQI prediction using ML models with evaluation metrics (R² score, MAE, RMSE).
>Visualizations showing AQI variation with respect to different features.


🎯 Future Scope
>Extend model to deep learning for better accuracy.
>Integrate real-time AQI data from APIs.
>Deploy as a web application for public use.
